Boards
==============================================================================
The robot orchestra uses multiple different microcontrollers for the different
musicians, and each of these has a corresponding project under the `boards/`
directory for its initialisation and HAL implementation code.

Aside from microcontroller-specific implementations, there is also a hosted
implementation (simply called `host`) for use during testing.

Each microcontroller-specific project has reference manuals in its
documentation directory, as well as any additional documentation for its HAL
implementation.
